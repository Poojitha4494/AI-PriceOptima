# PriceOptima – Dynamic Pricing System
## Milestone 1: KPI Definition • Dataset Preparation • Preprocessing
### 1. Project Overview

PriceOptima is a dynamic pricing system designed to optimize product prices using sales, cost, and inventory data.


### 2. KPI Definitions
#### A. Revenue Lift

Measures: Increase or decrease in revenue after dynamic pricing.

custom_sales["Dynamic Price"] = custom_sales["Price"] * 0.88
custom_sales["New Revenue"] = custom_sales["Dynamic Price"] * custom_sales["Units Sold"]


Why important: Shows pricing impact on revenue.

### B. Profit Margin Improvement

Measures: Change in profit before vs after pricing.

custom_sales["Original Profit"] = custom_sales["Revenue"] - (custom_sales["Cost Price"] * custom_sales["Units Sold"])
custom_sales["New Profit"] = custom_sales["New Revenue"] - (custom_sales["Cost Price"] * custom_sales["Units Sold"])


Why important: Ensures profitability increases.

### C. Inventory Impact

Measures: How pricing affects stock consumption.

Checked in code:

Stock levels validated

No negative inventory

Why important: Helps reduce excess stock faster.

# PriceOptima – Feature Engineering & Dynamic Pricing

## Project Overview
This notebook implements the **Feature Engineering phase** of the **PriceOptima Dynamic Pricing Project**.  
The objective of this stage is to transform raw customs sales data into a **model-ready dataset** by capturing demand patterns, pricing behavior, seasonality, inventory conditions, competitor influence, and profitability.

The output of this notebook is a fully engineered dataset that can be directly used for **machine learning models** and **dynamic pricing analysis**.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains historical sales and operational data with the following key columns:

- `Date`
- `Product ID`
- `Units Sold`
- `Price`
- `Revenue`
- `Cost Price`
- `Stock Level`
- `Warehouse/Store ID`
- `Competitor Price`
- `Competitor Name`
- (Optional) `Category`

---

## Feature Engineering Steps Performed

### 1. Time-Based Features
Extracted features to capture seasonality and weekly demand patterns:
- Year
- Month
- Day
- Weekday
- Weekend flag
- Season (Winter, Summer, Monsoon, Festive)
- Festival/Holiday indicator

---

### 2. Demand Features (Lag & Rolling)
Created features to understand historical demand trends:
- Lag sales (1-day, 7-day, 30-day)
- Rolling averages (7-day, 30-day)
- Demand volatility (rolling standard deviation)

---

### 3. Price-Based Features
Engineered features to capture pricing behavior:
- Revenue per unit
- Price change percentage
- Lag price (previous day)
- Discount percentage

---

### 4. Price Elasticity
Calculated elasticity to understand how demand reacts to price changes:
- Elasticity value
- Elasticity classification (High / Medium / Low)

---

### 5. Competitor Features
Incorporated competitive pricing signals:
- Competitor price difference
- Competitor index
- Competitor cheaper indicator

---

### 6. Inventory Features
Added operational constraints and stock insights:
- Inventory ratio
- Days until stock-out
- Low stock indicator

---

### 7. Profit Features
Calculated profitability metrics:
- Total profit
- Profit per unit
- Profit margin percentage

---

### 8. Interaction Features
Created interaction terms to capture combined effects:
- Weekend × Price
- Season × Discount
- Inventory × Price

---

### 9. Categorical Encoding
Converted categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding:
- Category (if available)

---

### 10. Dynamic Pricing Scenarios
Simulated multiple pricing strategies to evaluate business impact:

Price multipliers tested:
- 0.85 (−15%)
- 0.99 (−1%)
- 1.05 (+5%)
- 1.10 (+10%)
- 1.15 (+15%)

For each scenario, calculated:
- Predicted Price
- Predicted Revenue
- Revenue Lift (%)
- Predicted Profit
- Predicted Profit Margin (%)

---

### 11. Data Cleaning
Final preprocessing steps:
- Handled missing values
- Replaced infinite values
- Removed duplicates
- Exported clean dataset

---

## Output
- **Console Output:** Displays a preview of the engineered dataset (wrapped format is expected for wide tables).
- **Generated File:**  
  `customs_sales_features_DYNAMIC_FULL.csv`

# 📊 PriceOptima – Milestone 4  
## Baseline Rule-Based Pricing Engine

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains **Milestone 4** of the **PriceOptima Dynamic Pricing Project**.  
The objective of this milestone is to build a **baseline rule-based pricing engine** that adjusts product prices using **time-based** and **inventory-based** rules and compares the resulting revenue with **static pricing**.

This baseline system acts as a benchmark before implementing machine learning-based pricing models in later milestones.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Develop a pricing engine that:
- Applies **time-based pricing rules**
- Applies **inventory-based pricing rules**
- Generates a new **rule-based price**
- Compares **static vs rule-based revenue**
- Calculates **revenue uplift**

---

## 🧠 Pricing Strategy

### 1️⃣ Time-Based Pricing Rules
The following rules are applied based on time and demand patterns:

- Increase price on **weekends**
- Increase price during **festival / peak seasons**
- Apply a small increase during **month-end**
- Apply discounts during **low-demand months**

These rules simulate real-world seasonal and demand-driven pricing behavior.

---

### 2️⃣ Inventory-Based Pricing Rules
Prices are adjusted based on inventory levels:

- **Low inventory:** Increase price due to scarcity
- **Balanced inventory:** No price change
- **High inventory:** Apply moderate discount
- **Overstock:** Apply clearance pricing

These rules reflect practical retail inventory management strategies.

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Rule-Based Price Generation
- A new column called **`rule_price`** is created.
- The original price is copied and adjusted **sequentially** using:
  1. Inventory-based rules
  2. Time-based rules

This ensures logical and realistic price adjustments.

---

### Revenue Calculation
Two revenue metrics are calculated:

- **Static Revenue**
Static Revenue = Original Price × Units Sold


- **Rule-Based Revenue**
 Rule-Based Revenue = Rule Price × Units Sold


---

### Revenue Lift Calculation
Revenue uplift is calculated as:



Revenue Lift = Rule-Based Revenue − Static Revenue
Revenue Lift (%) = (Revenue Lift / Static Revenue) × 100

---

## 📈 Results
- Rule-based pricing dynamically adjusts prices based on demand and stock conditions.
- Revenue comparison demonstrates improvement over static pricing.
- The baseline engine provides a strong foundation for advanced pricing models.
